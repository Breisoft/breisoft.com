                Ever since Josh was 14, computers weren't just a hobbyâ€”they were
                a calling. This wasn't a fleeting interest but a lifelong
                commitment that propelled him into the expansive universe of
                coding, software engineering, and ultimately, entrepreneurship.
                To him, software engineering isn't just about assembling lines
                of code; it's about leveraging technology to solve real-world
                challenges and improve lives.

                Before he started doing software engineering at Breisoft, he
                co-founded Apollo Analytics LLC. He, along with his co-founder,
                pioneered solutions in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
                machine learning to predict cryptocurrency token market trends.
                The ingenuity of Apollo Analytics caught the eye of industry
